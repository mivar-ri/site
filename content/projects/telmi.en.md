Large amount of information is stored in text form: documents, letters, articles, reports. Text is the basis of knowledge and modern communications.

An important step in artificial intelligence development is teaching computer to understand natural language, analyse text meaning and work with context.

The main constraint in the process of developing artificial intelligence systems was inability to work with context and take into account polycemy of natural language. Computer is not always capable of understanding and taking into account language environment, communication situation, different lexical meanings of one word, usage of words. All these factors hamper recognition of the meaning conveyed by the author.

Tel!Mi, Mivar Test Personality Emulator, is a unique semantic platform designed on the basis of mivar principles. The platform efficiently solves the task of semantic text analysis and natural Russian language understanding.

Application of semantic technologies designed on the basis of mivar principles has allowed us to overcome considerable limitations in the field of natural Russian language understanding. New opportunities for development of intelligent products and solutions have been introduced, which seemed to be fantastic recently.

## How it works

Algorithms used in TEL!Mi consecutively convert text into the mivar semantic graph. The process of analysis includes text parsing, semantic conversion, graph building, as well as work with context and ambiguity elimination. System database consists of concepts, their definitions, system relations and contexts. Semantic graph and platform modules allow us not only search for words in the dictionary, but also identify context environment, which ensures completely accurate text meaning understanding.
