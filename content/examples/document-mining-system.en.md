## Application

Performance of any company can be represented as a combination of business processes. At each stage of business-process divisions of the company document information, collect statistics, compile reports on the results of work. These reports may contain errors of different types caused by human factor: errors in design, configuration, calculations, data conversion, false information, fraud. These errors may result in leakage of considerable amount of company’s legal revenue.

The system for detecting errors in documents was designed to prevent leakage of telecommunications company’s revenues. According to the requirements of the company, it was necessary to develop a system for detecting errors in the accounting documents concerning the lease of telecommunications equipment and estimating the cost of these errors. The logic, which the system is based on, can be applied to any cases related to control of revenue chain. The introduction of the system will ensure automation of monitoring and incident response processes.
